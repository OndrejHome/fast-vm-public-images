==== VM images and configs for fast-vm ====
This repository provides files needed by fast-vm to use images available publicly.
Files are structured in directories per-distribution and there are additional
README files for distributions containing more information about provided files.


==== Image download locations ====
Images that can be used with files here can be downloaded from following locations:
Primary location (slow - only 10 Mbit/s)
  - https://www.famera.cz/large_data/fast-vm-images/
Mirror locations (fast - up to 10000 Mbit/s)
  - http://ftp.linux.cz/pub/linux/people/ondrej_famera/fastvm-images/

Note: there are some distributions that prohibit distribution of images publicly.
(for example RHEL). Files provided for these distributions usualy contains scripts
that can be used to generate the fast-vm images if you have access to installation
media of these distributions.

==== System requirements ====
To use the hack files included in this repository you would need command
'guestfish' to be present and working on your system. In RPM based systems
like Fedora/RHEL/Centos you can install it using command below.

  # yum install libguestfs-tools-c
  # dnf install libguestfs-tools-c

Distributions that uses SELinux will need 'libguestfs' version that contains command
'selinux-relabel' for SELinux based hack files to work properly!
On RHEL/CentOS system this is included in version 1.32 while in original 'libguestfs'
packages this is available since version 1.34.

==== UEFI support ( from fast-vm-1.0 ) ====
For images with UEFI support you will need OVMF UEFI firmware and UEFI variables.
These should be present on the paths below:
  - /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd  (UEFI firmware)
  - /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd  (UEFI variables)
The UEFI variables file is used as template for creating per-machine nvram file
with variables automatically by libvirt (check /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf for more detail).

==== Structure of this repository ====
<distribution name>/xml/*.xml             - libvirt XML files for fast-vm
<distribution name>/hacks/*hacks.sh       - fast-vm standard hack files
<distribution name>/xml/*-uefi.xml        - UEFI libvirt XML files for fast-vm
<distribution name>/hacks/*hacks-uefi.sh  - UEFI fast-vm standard hack files
archived/<distribution name>              - versions that reached their End of life

==== How to use images with files from here ====
Example of CentOS 7.3 image import.

1a. Import image directly from web to your fast-vm installation or
  # fast-vm import_image c7.3 http://ftp.linux.cz/pub/linux/people/ondrej_famera/fastvm-images/generated/6g__centos-7.3.img.xz https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OndrejHome/fast-vm-public-images/master/centos/xml/centos-6.3-7.3.xml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OndrejHome/fast-vm-public-images/develop/centos/hacks/6g_centos-7-hacks.sh

1b. Download files manually to local filesystem and import them using command below
  # fast-vm import_image c7.3 6g__centos-7.3.img.xz centos-6.3-7.3.xml 6g_centos-7-hacks.sh

2. Wait for import to finish.

3. Now you are ready to go to create a new fast-vm VM based on image you have imported
  # fast-vm create c7.3 42
