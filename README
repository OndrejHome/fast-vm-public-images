==== How to install ====
example of 5.11 image import

1. run image import with fast-vm
  # fast-vm import_image 5.11 rhel-5.11.img.gz rhel-5.0-6.2.xml rhel-5-hacks.sh

## recommended further steps

2. create base image VM
  # fast-vm create 5.11 base

3. run manually base image VM and customize it to your liking
  # virsh start fastvm-5.11
  # virsh console fastvm-5.11
  (optional) change root password
  (optional) add your ssh key for easier SSH login
  ...

==== TODO ====
Add missing versions, as this was initially created for RHEL systems, but should 
apply for all CentOS systems as well
