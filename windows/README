== Windows

= Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Edition x64 (for evaluation purposes)
Image file for this version can be obtained from Microsoft site but it is not permited
to re-distribute it so here you will find only steps to take to create fast-vm image from it.

1. Download and unpack the image provided by MIcrosoft as described in the page below
  https://www.freeipa.org/page/Setting_up_Active_Directory_domain_for_testing_purposes#Download_and_unpack_original_images

2. Convert image to RAW format
  qemu-img convert -p -f vpc -O raw WS2008R2Fullx64Ent.vhd WS2008R2Fullx64Ent.img

3. (Optional but recommended) Get gparted Live ISO and resize the NTFS partition inside. The one provided
in the original image is over 120GB. Procedure will further assume that you have reduced the size of 'C:' drive
filesystem to 19800MB

4. If you have resized the filesystem in step 3 then also resize the raw image using command below.
  qemu-img resize -f raw WS2008R2Fullx64Ent.img 20G

5. Create custom fast-vm image with 20 GB disk and XML provided here
   fast-vm import_custom_image 20 win2k8r2 empty xml/win2k8r2.xml

6. (as root) copy the content of the image into new fast-vm image drive.
   dd if=WS2008R2Fullx64Ent.img of=/dev/$THINPOOL_VG/${VM_PREFIX}win2k8r2 bs=1M conv=sparse status=progress

After above procedure Create fast-vm VMs as you are used to with new image.
  fast-vm create win2k8r2 42
