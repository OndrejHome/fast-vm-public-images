 == CentOS 6.X UEFI ==
 - these images requires installation-specific nvram for proper function
   - the nvram must be available at following location /etc/fast-vm/nvram-${image_name}_VARS.fd
   - system won't boot without nvram!
   - nvrams are distributed next to image files
 - provided libvirt XML is supported from fast-vm 1.2

 == CentOS 7.5 PPC64LE ==
 - these iamges are intended for the qemu on x86_64 platform emulating PPC64LE
 - no hackfile for these images is available yet so the hostname is fixed
