 == CentOS 6.X UEFI ==
 - these images requires installation-specific nvram for proper function
   - the nvram must be available at following location /etc/fast-vm/nvram-${image_name}_VARS.fd
   - system won't boot without nvram!
   - nvrams are distributed next to image files
 - provided libvirt XML is supported from fast-vm 1.2

 == CentOS 7.5 PPC64LE ==
 - these images are intended for the qemu on x86_64 platform emulating PPC64LE
 - no hackfile for these images is available yet so the hostname is fixed

 == CentOS 6.X GUI ==
 - these images are installed with 'Desktop' package set and activates graphical login
 - XML for this images uses 2GB or RAM and includes graphic card for graphical output

 == CentOS 7.X GUI ==
 - these images are installed with 'Server with GUI' package set and activates graphical login
 - XML for this images uses 2GB or RAM and includes graphic card for graphical output

== CentOS 7 ext profiles
For fast-vm hypervisors that have configured 'system-bridge' software bridge as
described in the https://www.famera.cz/blog/fast-vm/user_guide.html#exposing-fast-vm-systems-to-external-network-via-bridge
there is set of XML file and hack file that creates VM with 2 network interfaces
with following properties:
- eth0 - (DHCP) internal network connected to other fast-vm machines
- eth1 - (DHCP) external network connected via 'system-bridge' and default route for system
To import profile, make sure that you first imported some centos-7.X image and then run following command to import profile
  # fast-vm import_profile centos-ext-7.X centos-7.X https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OndrejHome/fast-vm-public-images/master/centos/xml/centos-ext-7.0-current.xml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OndrejHome/fast-vm-public-images/master/centos/hacks/6g_centos-ext-7-hacks.sh
To create fast-vm VM with this configuration use the profile name as shown below
  # fast-vm create centos-ext-7.X XX
