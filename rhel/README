 == RHEL 6.X UEFI ==
 - these images requires installation-specific nvram for proper function
   - the nvram must be available at following location /etc/fast-vm/nvram-${image_name}_VARS.fd
   - system won't boot without nvram!
 - provided libvirt XML is supported from fast-vm 1.2

 == kickstart KNOWN ISSUES ==
 RHEL 6.3 installer is complaining about 'unsupported hardware' and needs manual step to continue
 RHEL 6.0 installer is trying to get IP from DHCP even if it should do that and needs manual step to continue
