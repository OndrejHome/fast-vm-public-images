! these images are not publicly available
## Login information
# user: root
# pass: testtest
- SSH enabled on boot with root login
## System details
! systems are not registered
- emulated Intel 6300ESB WatchDog
- no graphic card
- serial console configured for system and grub
- hostname configured according to VM_NAME from fast-vm
- systems installed using minimal option where available (rhel5 with many disabled options, check *.ks file for details)
- system would be running for the first time after installation
- disk drive connection:
  - RHEL 5.6, 6.0 - lsilogic SCSI controler (lsisas1078 is crashing installer kernel for these versions)
  - RHEL 5.0 - 5.5, 5.7 - 5.11, 6.1, 6.2 - lsisas1078 (megaraid) SCSI constroler with SCSI drive
  - (IDE) RHEL 5.0 - 6.2 - alternative images using IDE controller
  - RHEL 6.3 - 8.0 - SCSI drive using virtio SCSI controller (supports TRIM)
## Drive layout
- 6 GB drive
(RHEL 5)
  - 100MB /boot (1st partition)
  - LVM name (r5vg)
    - 256MB swap_lv
    - 4992MB root_lv
    - rest is free space on VG r5vg
(RHEL 6,7,8,9 non-UEFI version)
  - 500MB /boot (1st partition)
  - LVM name (rXvg, where X is 5, 6 or 7, according to RHEL major version)
    - 256MB swap_lv
    - 5000MB root_lv
    - rest is free space on VG rXvg
(RHEL 6,7,8 UEFI version)
  - 200MB /boot/efi (1st partition)
  - 500MB /boot (2nd partition)
  - LVM name (rXvg, where X is 6 or 7 according to RHEL major version)
    - 256MB swap_lv
    - 5000MB root_lv
    - rest is free space on VG rXvg

 == RHEL 6.X UEFI ==
 - these images requires installation-specific nvram for proper function
   - the nvram must be available at following location /etc/fast-vm/nvram-${image_name}_VARS.fd
   - system won't boot without nvram!
 - provided libvirt XML is supported from fast-vm 1.2

== RHEL 8.X libguestfs requirements ==
- RHEL 8.X uses a new features in XFS that some systems (RHEL/CentOS 7.x, libguestfs-appliance-1.38.0) don't have libguestfs appliance to handle such situation - state as of 19.11.2019 
- this can be workarounded by using appliance from Fedora 29 that can be downloaded from http://ftp.linux.cz/pub/linux/people/ondrej_famera/fastvm-images/appliance-1.39.11.tar.xz
- hack files contains check if running system is Fedora and if not they will try to use the custom Fedora 29 appliance in /var/tmp/fedora29/appliance
= Fedora 29 custom appliance installation:
  # mkdir /var/tmp/fedora29
  # cd /var/tmp/fedora29
  # wget http://ftp.linux.cz/pub/linux/people/ondrej_famera/fastvm-images/appliance-1.39.11.tar.xz
  # tar xf appliance-1.39.11.tar.xz
- to prevent appliance to be deleted after 30 days by 'systemd-tmpfiles' daemon you can create exception from cleanup as root user with command below
  # echo 'x /var/tmp/fedora29' > /etc/tmpfiles.d/fast-vm-fedora29-appliance.conf

 == kickstart KNOWN ISSUES ==
 RHEL 6.3 installer is complaining about 'unsupported hardware' and needs manual step to continue
 RHEL 6.0 installer is trying to get IP from DHCP even if it should do that and needs manual step to continue

== RHEL 9.X libguestfs requirements ==
- same as with RHEL 8.X there seems to be changes to XFS default options that requires newer appliance
- you can use the below steps to update fast-vm libguestfs appliance to verison that supports this XFS filesystem
= EL9-compatible libguestfs appliance
  # rm -rf /var/lib/fast-vm/appliance
  # wget http://ftp.linux.cz/pub/linux/people/ondrej_famera/fastvm-images/appliance-1.45.7.tar.xz
  # tar xvf appliance-1.45.7.tar.xz -C /var/lib/fast-vm
  # rm -f appliance-1.45.7.tar.xz

== RHEL 7 ext profiles
For fast-vm hypervisors that have configured 'system-bridge' software bridge as
described in the https://www.famera.cz/blog/fast-vm/user_guide.html#exposing-fast-vm-systems-to-external-network-via-bridge
there is set of XML file and hack file that creates VM with 2 network interfaces
with following properties:
- eth0 - (DHCP) internal network connected to other fast-vm machines
- eth1 - (DHCP) external network connected via 'system-bridge' and default route for system
To import profile, make sure that you first imported some rhel-7.X image and then run following command to import profile
  # fast-vm import_profile rhel-ext-7.X rhel-7.X https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OndrejHome/fast-vm-public-images/master/rhel/xml/rhel-ext-7.0-current.xml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OndrejHome/fast-vm-public-images/master/rhel/hacks/6g_rhel-ext-7-hacks.sh
To create fast-vm VM with this configuration use the profile name as shown below
  # fast-vm create rhel-ext-7.X XX
